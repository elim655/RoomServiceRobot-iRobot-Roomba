## Project Description:
The project introduces an innovative Autonomous Vehicle (AV) designed to enhance hotel room service by delivering food, toiletries, and other necessities directly to guests' rooms, especially during off-hours when traditional services may not be available. This robot navigates complex hotel environments, avoiding obstacles like pedestrians and luggage, and ensures deliveries are made promptly and efficiently, enhancing guest satisfaction.

## Problem Statement:
Guests often require room service during times when it's unavailable due to off-work hours of hotel labor. Traditional room service methods can be inefficient, leading to dissatisfaction. The proposed AV aims to solve this by providing a reliable, autonomous solution for delivering essentials to guests, navigating through various obstacles and ensuring timely deliveries, thereby addressing the gap in current hotel service offerings.

## Functional Requirements:
- Autonomous navigation through hotel hallways and around obstacles.
- Detection and avoidance of pedestrians, luggage, and construction zones.
- Delivery to the correct room while avoiding stairs and other hazards.
- Apologize through sound in case of unintended contact to maintain guest satisfaction.
- Utilize sensors for object detection and pathfinding.
- Operate in a manner that ensures timely deliveries.

## Prototype:
The CyBot, acting as the room service robot, will demonstrate capabilities in autonomous navigation, obstacle avoidance, and timely delivery of items to designated rooms, showcasing a practical application in enhancing hotel guest experience.

## Demonstration Narrative:
Envision a scenario where hotel guests can seamlessly receive their room service orders through an autonomous robot, navigating through busy hallways and around obstacles, ensuring that their needs are met promptly and efficiently, regardless of the time of day or staffing levels, thereby significantly improving the overall guest experience.

## Sources Used:
- Embedded Systems International materials and guides.
- Autonomous navigation and sensor integration research.
- Customer service and satisfaction studies in hotel management.
